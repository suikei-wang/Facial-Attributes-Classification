# Facial-Attributes-Classification
Facial attributes classification based on MobileNet, a light weight deep neural network using CelebA cropped dataset.

This project is for ENGN8536 in ANU.

### Requirement
See [requirement.txt](./requirement.txt) for further details.

### Dataset
[Large-scale CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) Dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html)<br>
**CelebA** is a large-scale facial images dataset containing 202,599 images with 40 different facial attributes labels. 

### Model
[MobileNets: Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks for Mobile Vision Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861) <br>
MobileNets model is on the basis of depthwise separable convolutions, which is a light weight deep neural network.

### Experiment
Main enviornment: Pytorch v1.3.1 on Google Colab<br>
Details of our experiment results is in our project report [Facial Attribute Classification: A Light Weight Deep Neural Network](Report/Facial_attributes_classification.pdf)
